\section{Research Activities}

The Data Assimilation Research Team (DA Team) was launched in October 2012 and is composed of 18 research and technical staff including 7 visiting members as of March 2016. Data assimilation (DA) is a cross-disciplinary science to synergize computer simulations and real-world data, based on statistical mathematics and dynamical systems theory. As computers advance and enable precise simulations, it will become more important to compare the simulations with real-world data. DA Team performs cutting-edge research and development on advanced DA methods and their wide applications, aiming to integrate computer simulations and real-world data in the wisest way. Particularly, DA Team tackles challenging problems of developing efficient and accurate DA systems for ``big simulations'' with real-world ``big data'' from various sources including advanced sensors. The specific foci include 1) theoretical and algorithmic developments for efficient and accurate DA, 2) DA methods and applications by taking advantage of the world-leading K computer and ``big data'' from new advanced sensors, and 3) exploratory new applications of DA in wider simulation fields. These advanced DA studies will enhance simulation capabilities and lead to a better use of high-performance computers including the leading-edge K computer.

In FY2015, we continued on the ongoing data assimilation research in the following aspects: 1) theoretical research on challenging problems, 2) leading research on meteorological applications, 3) optimization of computational algorithms, and 4) exploratory research on wider applications. We also continued close collaborations with several research teams within the AICS Research Division. We have made substantial progress on the following research items:

\section{Research Results and Achievements}


\subsection{Big Ensemble Data Assimilation in Numerical Weather Prediction}
\locallabel{sec:big_ensemble_da}
Taking advantage of the K computer,
we have successfully run the largest-ever ensemble DA experiments with 10,240 samples for the global atmosphere
with the real-case Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) (Miyoshi et al. 2015)
using the NICAM-LETKF (Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter) system developed in FY2014 (Terasaki et al. 2015).
This research result was highlighted by RIKEN Press Release on November 11, 2015.
The samples size of 10,240 is two orders of magnitude larger than the typical choice of about 100. The computational cost for the ensemble DA is proportional to the cubic power of the sample size, and active collaborations with AICS Large-scale Parallel Numerical Computing Technology Research Team (PI: Dr. T. Imamura) played an essential role in accelerating the computation by a factor of 8 using an eigenvalue solver “EigenExa” optimized for the K computer. The large sample size reduces the sampling error (Fig. \localref{fig:1}), and we discovered potential long-range correlations up to about 7,000 km (Fig. \localref{fig:1} b). This suggests potential use of faraway observations to improve numerical weather prediction (NWP), although we usually assume that the impact of observations is limited within a range up to 4,000 km or so. The large ensemble DA experiments would provide fundamental datasets to improve our knowledge on the flow-dependent error statistics including non-Gaussian and multi-scale structures, and would help develop advanced approaches for non-Gaussian and multi-scale DA, the topics at the center of theoretical DA research.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Near-real-time Implementation of Regional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)}
The LETKF-based DA system has been newly developed with the regional NWP model ``SCALE'' in collaboration with Computational Climate Science Research Team (PI: Dr. H. Tomita). Real-world observation data are available from the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in near real time, by about 3-hour delay from the real time. We have implemented the near-real-time 5-day NWP using the SCALE-LETKF system, and have been running continuously from May 7, 2015. Figure \localref{fig:3} indicates an example of a forecast in a case of the worst disaster in 2015 by flooding of River Kinugawa, Tochigi, Japan. The line-type system is well simulated. By continuously running SCALE-LETKF analysis and forecasts, we accumulate experiences and verification samples, which will be very useful for further improvements of DA and NWP system developments.

  \locallabel{fig:3}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Effective Use of Satellite Big Data}
Developing DA methods for effective use of various observation data is important. Satellite remote sensing provides a relatively uniform coverage of a broad area of the globe, and plays an essential role in NWP. However, the observed quantities are not direct to the prognostic variables of NWP models, and the data volume and variety keep increasing rapidly as sensor technology advances. Therefore, satellite DA requires algorithmic and methodological developments, and has become a major field in meteorology. We have been actively working on the research on effective assimilation of satellite-based precipitation data including the GPM (global precipitation measuring mission) core satellite data in collaboration with JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), microwave radiances from low-earth orbit satellites, and big data from the new-generation geostationary satellite Himawari-8 in collaboration with JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency) Meteorological Satellite Center and Meteorological Research Institute. Figure \localref{fig:4} shows an example of the impact of assimilating Himawari-8 infrared radiances in the case of Typhoon Soudelor 2015. The outer rainbands north of the vortex are greatly enhanced by assimilating Himawari-8 and becomes much closer to the observation.

  \locallabel{fig:4}
\end{figure}

\subsection{New Application with Individual-based Dynamical Vegetation Model}
As a new explorative application of DA, we have been working on land-surface and vegetation applications. We have successfully applied DA to the Spatially-Explicit Individual-Based Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SEIB-DGVM) for the first time. The individual-based model simulates individual plants explicitly; some trees may die, while new trees may emerge. Therefore, the model prognostic variables such as tree height and root depth may change time to time and place to place. Typical DA methods assume the phase space to be predefined and never change. Alternatively, we applied a SIR (Sequential Importance Resampling) particle filter. The results were encouraging. Figure \localref{fig:5} shows the results with the real satellite-based MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LAI (Leaf Area Index) observations at a single location. It is not surprising that the uncertainties of the simulated LAI are reduced significantly (Fig. \localref{fig:5} a), but we also find that the uncertainties of unobserved model parameters and variables are reduced significantly (Fig. \localref{fig:5} b, c).

  \locallabel{fig:5}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Theoretical and algorithmic developments}
\locallabel{sec:theoretical}
Theoretical DA research is an important part of DA Team’s scope. Here, we highlight some of the major theoretical developments in FY2015.
A paper on the discrete Bayesian optimization approach to find optimal ensemble sizes in a multi-model ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) was published (Otsuka and Miyoshi 2015).
Potential impact of assimilation order of observations in serial EnKF was investigated (Kotsuki et al., manuscript in preparation).
A new local particle filter method to treat non-Gaussian PDF was explored (Penny and Miyoshi 2016, \textit{Nonlin.\ Processes Geophys.\ Discuss.}).

\section{Schedule and Future Plan}

In FY2015, DA team had one additional full-time research staff, and the team will grow further in FY2016.
DA team has been exploring various aspects of DA including theoretical problems, meteorological applications, and wider applications,
with large-scale computing to fully utilize ``Big Data.''
We have very strong projects in weather forecast applications supported by the JST CREST program, JAXA, and MEXT FLAGSHIP 2020 project.
We will continue our efforts in each topic in FY2016.

``Big Data Assimilation'' (BDA) is one of the major activities that we have developed in FY2015.
The prototype system showed promising results, but the computing speed with the K computer did not meet the requirement for real-time implementation.
Also, the physical performance for the 30-minute forecast of precipitation patterns needs to be improved.
In FY2016, we will continue to work on the development of the BDA system to further improve the computational and physical performances.

In FY2016, we also plan to enhance close collaborations with experts in mathematics, sensor technology, and various application fields.
Enhancing collaborations with other AICS Research Teams will also be beneficial.
